Context: Development environment enhancement for Scheme Terminal UI project

Considerations:
- Emacs configuration supports both local and remote development via TRAMP
- Tmux session provides split-pane workflow with editor and REPL side-by-side
- Geiser integration allows interactive Scheme development with Guile 3
- Paredit ensures structural editing for S-expressions
- Project variables in Makefile enable portable path resolution

Technical Details:
- Added PROJECT_ROOT variable using $(shell pwd) for dynamic path resolution
- Emacs config auto-loads packages and configures Geiser for Guile
- Tmux targets manage named sessions with automatic pane setup
- get-tty target provides TTY info for debugging and automation

Issues Addressed:
- Lack of integrated development environment for Scheme code
- Manual REPL and editor coordination
- Missing project-specific Emacs configuration

Timing: 2025-08-06
Duration: ~5 minutes
Tools: Makefile enhancements, Elisp configuration, tmux automation
