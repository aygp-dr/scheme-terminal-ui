Implementation notes for v0.1.0 release preparation:

Thought process:
- Started with thorough analysis of existing repository structure
- Identified broken dependency check script and fixed unterminated comment issue
- Established proper Guile Scheme project structure following best practices
- Implemented core functionality before creating examples to ensure working foundation
- Created comprehensive test suite to validate all functionality

Debugging/Issues encountered:
- Fixed unterminated #\! comment in experiments/000-deps-check/check.scm
- Resolved widget rendering issues by implementing proper keyword argument handling
- System shows Guile 2.2.7 instead of expected 3.x (noted in documentation)
- Minor warning about version symbol override in core module (acceptable for now)

Cleanup performed:
- Created complete project infrastructure (LICENSE, .gitignore, Makefile)
- Established src/terminal-ui/ module structure with proper exports
- Updated README.org to accurately reflect current implementation status
- Added VERSION file for release management
- Created working examples that demonstrate actual framework capabilities
- Implemented comprehensive test suite with 14 passing tests

Technical decisions:
- Used S-expression based widget system for declarative UI composition
- Implemented keyword argument support for widget styling and behavior
- Created modular architecture separating core, widgets, and layout concerns
- Chose simple pattern matching for initial rendering implementation
- Established proper Guile module system with appropriate exports

Future improvements:
- Implement proper styling system with ANSI color codes
- Add event handling and interactive capabilities
- Develop constraint-based layout system
- Add ASCII art and graphics rendering capabilities
- Implement theming and advanced styling options
- Add more widget types (tables, forms, progress bars)
- Optimize rendering performance for large UIs
